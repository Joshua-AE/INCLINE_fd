# Loading files
```{r}
cover <- readr::read_tsv("../Data/INCLINE_community_species_cover.txt", guess_max = Inf, trim_ws = TRUE)
traits <- read_tsv("../Data/PFTC6_Incline_clean_leaf_traits_2022.txt", guess_max = Inf, trim_ws = TRUE)
```

# Removing problematic entries
```{r}
# observations can be filtered based on: comment, problem, flag
# two files can be produced: one with NA values for certain traits in a sample and one without NAs (meaning each sample has a value for all 5 traits)
# comments and remarks can be completely omitted
```
