# Packages
```{r echo = FALSE, print = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Re-arranging data frame
```{r}

traits <- select(raw_traits, c(siteID, blockID, warming, species, trait, value)) %>% na.omit() %>%
  filter(trait %in% c("ldmc", "leaf_area_cm2", "leaf_thickness_mm", "plant_height_cm", "sla_cm2_g"))# one sample removed: DLL3549

# all rows in the comm matrix have to sum to 1. rownames = sampling units, colnames = species
# traits in the traits table should be scaled, centered and not highly correlated. rownames = species, colnames = traits.
# colnames in comm and rownames in trait have to match!

# first, compute hypervolume all species and traits, but only in control plots
