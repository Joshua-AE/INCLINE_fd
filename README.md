# INCLINE_fd: Collaborative analysis on intraspecific plant trait response to experimental warming
in alpine scrub along a precipitation gradient

The aim of this repository is to analyse the obtained trait data and to produce tables and graphs
that can be used in a publication that focusses on the INCLINE project.
The code for general data cleaning and preparation for both the INCLINE and 3D project
can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/Plant-Functional-Trait-Course/PFTC6_Norway
The ready-to-use INCLINE trait dataset can be found in OSF: https://osf.io/fcbw4/
