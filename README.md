Collaborative analysis on plant trait response to experimental warming in alpine grasslands along a precipitation gradient

In this repository, each task (e.g. doing analysis based on mixed effect models etc.) has its own branch. Each collaborator can work on the repository directly from their PC. The main branch is protected and cannot (or should not) be altered unless one task is done and a branch can be merged.
Data tables for the analyses can be stored in the data folder and should not be bigger than 50 MB (optimally not bigger than 10 MB).
